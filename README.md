Half the files gone in a snap… and back again just as fast ⚡📂


🚀 Thanos Project 🚀

I recently finished a new project that strengthened my ability to work with the operating system using Python.

Firstly, we have two folders: Universe and Backup. The Universe folder contains 50 images, while the Backup folder is initially empty. Then I applied the following process on these files:

📂 Create a backup of images from the Universe folder into the Backup folder.

🗑️ Randomly delete half the images in the Universe folder each run.

🔄 Repeat the process until the Universe folder is completely empty.

♻️ Restore all images back from the Backup folder.

🆕 Create another folder with randomized copies of images, each renamed with unique 5-letter filenames.


💡 This project highlights how automation can simplify workflows, allowing us to manage thousands of files with a single command instead of handling them manually.

You may ask what the relation is between this project and Thanos 🤔✨.

Well, just like Thanos in the Avengers movie could wipe out half the planet with a single snap, this project shows how we can handle thousands of files in the same effortless way.
